# Signal Sampling Studio
This is a web application that allows users to sample signals using Nyquist, generate sinusoidal signals at the UI using frequency and amplitude, display CSV signals, adjust the sampling frequency range with a maximum frequency of the signal, add sample points when adjusting the sampling slider, reconstruct the signal from the sampled points, add noise to the signal using a slider and remove it using a button, and show a graph that displays the difference between the original and the sampled signal. Users can also save the signal using a save button.

# Features
- Generate sinusoidal signals at the UI using frequency and amplitude.
- Display CSV signals.
- Adjust the sampling frequency range with a maximum frequency of the signal.
- Add multiple signals to each other
- Add sample points when adjusting the sampling slider.
- Reconstruct the signal from the sampled points.
- A slider to add noise to the signal and a button to remove it.
- A graph that shows the difference between the original and the sampled signal.
- Saving the signal using the save button.

# Usage
The application has a user-friendly interface that allows users to generate sinusoidal signals, adjust the sampling frequency range, add sample points, and add noise to the signal. Users can also save the signal as a CSV file and view the difference between the original and the sampled signal on a graph.

EMG Signal after sampling, you can notice that the slider mamx rate is 32 which changes with respect to the max frequency of the signal
